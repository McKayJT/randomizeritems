# A simple python script for randomizers

What matters more when watching somebody play a
randomizer is the key items they have gotten, rather
than splits. This program allows you to quickly set up
an item tracker with nothing more than a few images.

In order to use the hooks feature, you probably need to
be using
[my customized version of nestopia.](https://github.com/McKayJT/nestopia/tree/randomizer-hacks)

It also contains a built-in timer, because I wanted it
for my convenience.

Check out the config.json example. The graphics are not
provided because I don't have public domain graphics, but
you can get the idea of what you need to supply. They will be
resized by the application to the size specified in the
configuration file.
